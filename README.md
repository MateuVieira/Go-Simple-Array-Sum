### Description

> This problem was taken from Hackerrank for the Simple Array Sum - Patrice Algorithms.

Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.

For example, if the array *ar = [1,2,3]*, *1+2+3=6*, so return *6*.

Function Description

Complete the simpleArraySum function in the editor below. It must return the sum of the array elements as an integer.

simpleArraySum has the following parameter(s):
 
 - ar: an array of integers
 
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains  space-separated integers representing the array's elements.

Constraints

```bash
0 < n, ar[i] <= 1000
```

Output Format

Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.

Sample Input

```
6
1 2 3 4 10 11
```

Sample Output
```
31
```
Explanation

We print the sum of the array's elements: *1+2+3+4+10+11 = 31*.

### Motivation
I'm starting to learn to program in Go and I believe that one of the best ways is coding.
